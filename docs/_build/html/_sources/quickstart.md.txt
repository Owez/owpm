# Quickstart

`owpm` is a simple python package manager, like `poetry` or `pipenv`.

## Installing

```bash
pip3 install owpm.py
```

Or to build an executable on Linux,

```bash
./buildexe.sh # It will output ./build/owpm/
```

NOTE: If you are using this, never move owpm.exe outside of the `owpm/` folder.

## Using

```bash
owpm --help
```

If that does not work,

```bash
python3 -m owpm --help
```
